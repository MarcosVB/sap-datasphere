# Contributions to the SAP Datasphere Documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our official documentation on SAP Help Portal. The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

You can currently make contributions to the following guides in this repository:
- [Integrating Data and Managing Spaces](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/be5967d099974c69b77f4549425ca4c0?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=cloud)

## Contributing

We recommend using the SAP Datasphere documentation on SAP Help Portal as a starting point for contributions:

1. Open the SAP Datasphere Documentation:
   - [Integrating Data and Managing Spaces](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/be5967d099974c69b77f4549425ca4c0?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=cloud)
   - [Acquiring, Preparing, and Modeling Data](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/c8a54ee704e94e15926551293243fd1d?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=cloud)
   - [Administering SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/9f804b8efa8043539289f42f372c4862?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=cloud)
3. You can either:
    * Choose *Edit* to suggest a change for the current page you see in the Help Portal viewer, or
    * Choose *Feedback* to open a GitHub issue in this repository.

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
