# Enable the SAP HANA Cloud Script Server on Your SAP Datasphere Tenant

You can enable the SAP HANA Cloud script server on your SAP Datasphere tenant to access the SAP HANA Automated Predictive Library \(APL\) and SAP HANA Predictive Analysis Library \(PAL\) machine learning libraries.

To enable the SAP HANA Cloud script server, an S-user must request this service with an SAP ticket. For a step-by-step guide to creating the ticket, see [2994416 - Enablement of APL and PAL in DWC](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2994416).

> ### Note:  
> The script server cannot be enabled in a SAP Datasphere trial version.

Once the script server is enabled, the *Enable Automated Predictive Library and Predictive Analysis Library* option can be selected when creating a database user \(see [Create a Database User](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/internal/en-US/798e3fd6707940c3bd2219b2d1ebaac2.html "Users with the DW Space Administrator or DW Integrator role (space administrators and integrators) can create database users, granting them privileges to read from and/or write to an Open SQL schema with restricted access to the space schema.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
