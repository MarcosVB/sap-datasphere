# Update Your Free Plan to Standard Plan in SAP BTP

Update your service instance from free plan to standard plan.

In SAP Business Technology Platform \(SAP BTP\), if you have an SAP Datasphere service instance with a free plan, which you can use for 90 days, you can update it to a standard plan \(no time limitation\) for productive purposes. The number of days before the expiration is displayed in the top panel of SAP Datasphere.

To do so, you must have SAP BTP administration authorization on the subaccount that is entitled to SAP Datasphere.

1.  In SAP BTP, select the subaccount and the space where the service instance with a free plan was created.

2.  Navigate to *Instances and Subscriptions*.

3.  In the *Service Instances* page, find the SAP Datasphere service instance with the free plan, click the button at the end of the row and select *Update*.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can update a service instance with free plan to standard plan at least 6 hours after the service instance with free plan has been created.

4.  In the *Update Instance* dialog, select *standard* and click *Update Instance*.

    You can view the progress of the update. The status of the instance becomes green when the update is completed.

    > ### Note:  
    > During the update process \(around 30 minutes\), some features do not work as expected.
