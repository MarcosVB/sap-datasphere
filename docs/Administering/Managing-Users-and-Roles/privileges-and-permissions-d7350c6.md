# Privileges and Permissions

A privilege represents a task or an area in SAP Datasphere and can be assigned to a specific role. The actions that can be performed in the area are determined by the permissions assigned to a privilege.

This topic contains the following sections:

## Overview

A role represents the main tasks that a user performs in SAP Datasphere. Each role has a set of privileges with appropriate levels of permissions. The privileges represent areas of the application like the *Space Management* or the *Business Builder* and the files or objects created in those areas.

The standard application roles provide sets of privileges and permissions that are appropriate for that role. For example, the *DW Administrator* role has all the *Spaces* permissions, while the *DW Viewer* role has none.

You can use the standard application roles to assign sets of privileges and permissions to your users \(see [Standard Application Roles](standard-application-roles-a50a51d.md)\) and create your own custom roles to group together other sets of privileges and permissions \(see [Create a Custom Role](create-a-custom-role-862b88e.md)\).

## SAP Datasphere Privileges and Permissions

The following table lists the privileges and the permissions that can be set for each privilege.

> ### Note:  
> Some permissions require others and may automatically set them. For example, setting the *Delete* permission for the *Data Warehouse Data Builder* privilege automatically sets the *Read* permission as well.
