# Managing Roles and Privileges

Assigning roles to your users maintains access rights and secures your information in SAP Datasphere.

A role is a set of permissions grouped together and is then assigned to users. The pre-defined standard roles are grouped by the license type they consume. With SAP Datasphere you would, for example, see SAP Datasphere specific roles. Tenant administrators can also create their own custom roles by selecting individual privileges and permissions they would like their new role to have.
