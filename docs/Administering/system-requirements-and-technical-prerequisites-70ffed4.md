SAP Datasphere is a Web 2.0 application. We recommend allowing browser caching because the application uses it heavily for static content such as image files. If you clear your cache, the browser will not perform as well until the deleted files are downloaded again to the browser and cached for use next time.

To set browser cache size, see your browser documentation.
