# Monitoring Data Provisioning Agent in SAP Datasphere

For connected Data Provisioning Agents, you can proactively become aware of resource shortages on the agent instance and find more useful information.

In *Configuration* \> *Data Integration* \> *On-Premise Agents* choose the *Monitor* button to display the agents with the following:

-   Information about free and used physical memory and swap memory on the Data Provisioning Agent server.

-   Information about when the agent was connected the last time.

-   Information about the overall number of connections that use the agent and the number of connections that actively use real-time replication, with active real-time replication meaning that the connection type supports real-time replication and for the connection at least one table is replicated via real-time replication.

    You can change to the *Connections* view to see the agents with a list of all connections they use and their real-time replication status. You can pause real-time replication for the connections of the while applying changes to the agent. For more information, see [Pause Real-Time Replication for an Agent](pause-real-time-replication-for-an-agent-dac31a5.md).
