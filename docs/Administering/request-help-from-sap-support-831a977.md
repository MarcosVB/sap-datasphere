# Request Help from SAP Support

You can request help from SAP Product Support by creating a support incident. In many cases, you should create a support user to allow an SAP support engineer to log into and troubleshoot your system.

You can create an SAP support incident on the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/). For detailed information about what to include in an incident, see SAP Note [2854764](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2854764).

An administrator can create a special support user to allow an SAP support engineer to connect to your system to troubleshoot the problem. This user has minimum privileges and does not consume a user license. You can delete this support user when your issue is resolved.

To create a support user, select <span class="SAP-icons"></span> from the main toolbar, choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> Create Support User, and then choose *OK* in the dialog. A message is displayed once the support user is created.

An email is automatically sent to SAP Support to notify them of the newly created support user, and it is listed with your other users at *Security* \> *Users*.

For more information, see SAP Note [2891554](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2891554).
