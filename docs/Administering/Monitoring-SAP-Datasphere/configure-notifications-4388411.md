## Notify All Users about Network Connection Issues

When there are problems with a system, your users would like to know whether it is something that they control or if the issues are related to the network. You can't create messages for all situations, but you can let them know when the network connection is unstable.

To turn on the connection notification:

1.  In the side navigation area, click *System* \> *Administration* \> *Notifications*.

2.  To enable editing of all settings on the page, click *Edit*.

3.  In the *Connections Notifications* section, change the toggle to *ON*.

4.  Click *Save* to commit your changes.


When the notification is on, everyone who uses the application on that tenant will see the notification in the top right corner of their application.
