By default, the dialog displays a list of users whose consent will expire within four weeks. You can change the default expiration timeframe to anywhere between one and four weeks. In addition to displaying the list of users whose consent will soon expire, you can also select a user in the list and click the *Show Affected Tasks* link to view the collection of tasks that user has scheduled.
