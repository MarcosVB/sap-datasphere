# Data Shipment

See how the data product will be delivered to your space.

The delivery of data products is either managed by Data Marketplace \(direct\) or by the data provider \(indirect\). Depending on the physical shipment that your data provider offers, you might need to provide some additional information.

Integrated Delivery

The data is copied directly into the space you've selected. After activating the product, a protocol is created in *My Data Products* → *Delivery Tracking*. Once the data is available, you can use the data as any other data in SAP Datasphere, for example, by using the data as a source in the *Data Builder*. The data also becomes visible in the *Explorer*.

Open SQL

</td>
<td valign="top">

You need to create an OpenSQL Schema in the Space Management and share the details with the Data Provider. The Data Provider is then able to push the data directly into your tenant. Once data is delivered into the OpenSQL Schema by the data provider, it is then accessible through the *Data Builder* and the provided schema appears as a source. Inside this schema, you'll find the data as views or tables.

The data is delivered by sharing files outside SAP Datasphere.
