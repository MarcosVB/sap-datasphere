## Introduction to Folders

Folders help to organize objects in your space. You can create a folder in the *Repository Explorer*, *Data Builder*, or *Business Builder* and it is immediately available across each of these apps.

Once a folder is created, you can move objects to it or create objects in it. You can create as many levels of folder as necessary.

> ### Note:  
> Each object in a space must have a unique technical name. You may not create two views with the name *Sales\_US* in the *Sales* space, even if they are saved in different folders.
