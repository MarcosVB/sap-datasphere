# Finding and Accessing Data in the Catalog

Discover data by searching and filtering results. Mark your favorite assets, terms, and key performance indicators \(KPIs\).

The catalog provides an effective data governance strategy by bringing together an organized inventory of business metadata and data assets to enable business and technical users to unlock the full potential of their enterprise data. The catalog is a central place to discover, classify, understand, and prepare all the data in your enterprise.

Use the catalog to find the single-source of truth for your data domain to build reusable business models. With the catalog, you can find which stories are impacted by your changes. It all begins by finding the data you need.

You can search for assets by clicking <span class="SAP-icons"></span>\(*Catalog*\) in the side navigation menu.

You can find assets globally by using the search bar and entering all or part of the characters in a term or asset. Click :mag:

You can see the published terms, assets, and KPIs that are in a current state.

Then use the filter options to narrow the results by assets, terms, or KPIs and the different criteria in each of those categories. Access the filter options by clicking <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Show filters\).

Filter the search results based on selected criteria to limit the number of results. There are five tabs next to the *Filter* icon that you can use to narrow your results:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

</th>
<th valign="top">

Description



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

All



</td>
<td valign="top">

All the objects in the catalog are shown.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Assets



</td>
<td valign="top">

Shows only assets. An asset is any data or analytic object made available in the catalog. Assets are the objects that you provide governance around and publish to the catalog for users to discover, evaluate, and ultimately open and start using for their work.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Terms



</td>
<td valign="top">

Shows only terms. Terms are contained in a business glossary and provide meaning to your data. The business glossary provides a central and shared repository for defining terms and describing how and where they are used in the business.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

KPIs



</td>
<td valign="top">

Shows only key performance indicators \(KPIs\). KPIs measure progress towards a result such as a goal or objective. Use KPIs to track performance and provide an analytical basis for decision-making.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

<td valign="top">

<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can also open a side panel when you click <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Show filters\) to filter by these categories and more. Click *Show More* to open a dialog with additional filter options.

Under the *All* collection type, click either *Terms*, *Assets*, or *KPIs* to view additional criteria.

## Filter Options

Select one of the checkboxes and the results are automatically narrowed. Some categories have more options than are shown on the side panel.
