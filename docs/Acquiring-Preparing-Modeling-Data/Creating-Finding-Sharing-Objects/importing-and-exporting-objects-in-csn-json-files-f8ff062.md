# Importing and Exporting Objects in CSN/JSON Files

You can use the tools in certain *Data Builder* editors to import objects to and export objects from your space.

The following object types can be exported and imported via CSN files:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Object Type



</th>
<th valign="top">

Details



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Local Tables



</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a local table contains the structure of the table only, and does not have dependencies on any other objects.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Remote Tables



</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a remote table contains information about its connection. Before importing a remote table, you must create the relevant connection with an identical technical name in the receiving space.

> ### Note:  
> Remote tables exported from one space can be imported into another only if they were originally imported from a connection created in v2021.19 or later.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Views



</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a view contains the definitions of all its sources and any used data access controls. When you export a view, these objects are exported too.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Data Flows



</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a data flow contains the definitions of all its sources and its target table. When you export a data flow, these objects are exported too.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Intelligent Lookups

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Analytic Models

<td valign="top">
