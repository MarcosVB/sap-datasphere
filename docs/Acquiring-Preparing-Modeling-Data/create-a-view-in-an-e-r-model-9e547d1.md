# Create a View in an E/R Model

You can create a view directly in an E/R model, and complete the definition of the view in the graphical view editor.



## Procedure

1.  Select a table or view in the diagram as a source for the new view, and click <span class="FPA-icons-V3">î œ</span> \(Create View from Selection\) to open the *Create View* dialog.

2.  Enter a business name and a technical name for the new view.

    Optionally, select *Open in View Builder* to open the view in the graphical view editor upon creation.

3.  Click *OK* to create the view in the diagram.

    If you selected *Open in View Builder*, you will be prompted to save your E/R model and the new view will open in the graphical view editor \(see [Creating a Graphical View](creating-a-graphical-view-27efb47.md)\).
