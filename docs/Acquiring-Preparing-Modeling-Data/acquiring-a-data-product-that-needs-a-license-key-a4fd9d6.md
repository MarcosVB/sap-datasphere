## Prerequisites

You need a space and you need to be assigned to this space as a user.



## Context

You want to acquire a product that needs to be activated with a license key.



## Procedure

1.  If the data provider uses an external shop for the purchasing of licenses, click on *Get License* on top of the data product page. After you read through the disclaimer text, click on *Agree*. You will be forwarded to the shop of the data provider. Here you can purchase the license for the data product. Proceed with step 4. In case there is no *Get License* button, contact the data provider with the e-mail icon and follow steps 2-3.

2.  Negotiate with the data provider outside the Data Marketplace the payment method and the price.

3.  Once payment is done, the data provider will send the license key.

4.  Go back to the relevant data product page and click *Load with License Key*.

5.  Enter the activation key you have received from your data provider.

6.  Select a space to download the data product to.

    When you click on the icon on the right-hand side of the input field you get a list of all spaces that are assigned to you. Select one of them. You can also type the name of the space in the input field. You will receive auto-suggests as you type.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the product was already installed in one space, you can't install it a second time in this space.

7.  Select the *Update Mode* that fits you needs.

    Data products that are delivered in full mode can receive updates. Updates are available under *My Data Products* \> *Update \(tab\)*.

8.  Read the terms of use and check the additional information if available.

9.  Click *Load Product*.
