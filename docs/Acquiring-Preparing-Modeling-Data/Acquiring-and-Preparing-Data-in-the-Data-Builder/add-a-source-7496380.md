# Add a Source

Define the source for your replication flow \(connection, container, and objects\).



<a name="loio749638060e8746e48b0f9bf0e50c6d0c__context_x4r_ghf_vvb"/>

## Context

-   Connections are created by your system administration. You can only use a data source if a connection has been created for it in your space and if you have the necessary authorizations.

-   Containers are the parent objects that hold the data. For a CDS view, for example, the container is the relevant CDS root folder.

-   Replication objects are the datasets that you choose for replication, for example CDS views or database tables.




## Procedure

1.  Choose *Select Source Connection* at the bottom left of the screen. A list of available source connections appears. Select the relevant one for your use case.

    If you are not sure which one to choose, or if none of the connections in the list is suitable for your purposes, contact your administrator.

    Alternatively, you can get started by clicking <span class="FPA-icons">î›Š</span> \(Browse source connections\)

2.  Choose *Select Source Container*. A list of available source containers appears. Select the relevant one for your use case.

    To narrow down the selection, start typing a part of the folder name in the *Search* field.

3.  Choose *Add Source Objects*. A list of available objects appears. Select the relevant ones for your use case and choose *Next*. A list of the objects you selected appears.

    > ### Note:  
    > Objects for which replication is not supported are not shown in the list. For example, when replicating data from an SAP S/4HANA source you will only be shown CDS views that have the required annotations for data extraction.

4.  If you decide that you do not want to include an object after all, select it and choose *Remove from Selection*. If you want to include more objects, go back to the *Available* tab and select the relevant objects. When you are done, choose *Add Selection*. The system then imports the object definitions so that they are available for the subsequent process steps.

    > ### Note:  
    > An object can only be included in one replication flow at any given point in time \(not multiple ones\).

## Results

You have all necessary information about your data source in place and can move on to add your target.
