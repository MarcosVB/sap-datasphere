# Processing Changes to Source and Target Tables

If source or target tables of your transformation flow are modified, you can review the changes and decide how your transformation flow should handle the changes.

It is only possible to review target table changes in the *Transformation Flow Editor* and source table changes in the *View Transform Editor*. For more information, see [Process Target Changes in the Transformation Flow Editor](process-target-changes-in-the-transformation-flow-editor-75ab3ef.md) and [Process Source Changes in the View Transform Editor](process-source-changes-in-the-view-transform-editor-098ada1.md).
