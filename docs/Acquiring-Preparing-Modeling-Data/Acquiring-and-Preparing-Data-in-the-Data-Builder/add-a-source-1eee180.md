# Add a Source

Drag a table or view from the *Source Browser* panel and drop it on the diagram.



## Procedure

1.  If the *Source Browser* panel is not visible on the left of the screen, click *Source Browser* in the toolbar to show it.

2.  Browse or search for the object you want to add on either of the tabs.

    -   The *Repository* tab lists all the tables, views, and intelligent lookups that are available in the space \(including objects shared to the space\). You can search and expand the categories \(see [Add Objects from the Repository](add-objects-from-the-repository-13fcecd.md)\).

    -   The *Sources* tab lists all the connections and other data sources that have been integrated to the space from which you can import tables. You can:

        -   Expand the data sources to browse through their objects \(see [Import an Object from a Connection or Other Source](import-an-object-from-a-connection-or-other-source-3e6f8f2.md)\).
        -   Open the *Import Objects from Connection* dialog on a particular connection to select multiple objects for import \(see [Import Multiple Objects from a Connection](import-multiple-objects-from-a-connection-e720b13.md)\).


3.  Select the object of your choice, and then drag and drop it onto the diagram.

     ![](images/Create_Source_Gif_fec4071.gif)The source is added to the diagram, its symbol is selected, and its properties are displayed in the side panel. In addition, an output node, initially entitiled ***View 1***, which represents the final output structure of the view, is created in the diagram and linked to the source.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you choose a table or view from the *Sources* tab, it is automatically imported into the repository and deployed, and will be available on the *Repository* tab for future use by you or others.

4.  If the source is a view containing one or more input parameters \(see [Create an Input Parameter](create-an-input-parameter-53fa99a.md)\), the *Map Input Parameters* dialog is displayed, and you must decide how each input parameter will be processed:

    -   *Map To* - Map the source input parameter to an input parameter in the view. You can select an existing input parameter or create a new one.

        Users of this view will need to provide a value for the input parameter.

    -   *Set Value* - Enter a value to resolve the input parameter.

        The input parameter is resolved and users of this view will no longer need to provide a value for it.


    > ### Note:  
    > You can click *Cancel* in the dialog and not map the input parameters immediately, but then an error is displayed on the source, and you must subsequently map them in the source side panel *Input Parameters* section.

    The source symbol displays the number of input parameters present in the source. In this example, the source view and output view both contain two input parameters::

5.  Click <span class="FPA-icons">î›±</span> \(Preview Data\) to open the *Data Preview* panel and review the data output by this node. For more information, see [Viewing or Previewing Data in Data Builder Objects](viewing-or-previewing-data-in-data-builder-objects-b338e4a.md).
