</td>
<td valign="top">

A calculated measure references other measures and allows the combination of measures with elementary arithmetic \(operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\), and also more complex functions like maximum/minimum, IF \(as function\), mathematical functions like round, and conversion functions like convert to decfloat.



</td>
