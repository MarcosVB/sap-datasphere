# Add an External Hierarchy

You can add one or more external parent-child hierarchies which have been defined in the source view in the Data Builder.

## Context

External hierarchies are not created within a business entity; instead, they are stored in separate hierarchy tables and can be used in views.



## Procedure

1.  Go to the *Hierarchies* tab.

2.  To add a hierarchy, choose <span class="FPA-icons-V3">î˜‰</span> \(Add\).

3.  Select your hierarchy and choose *Apply*. The key mapping and the hierarchy structure will be prefilled. The hierarchy structure cannot be changed here, ony in the hierarchy view in the Business Builder.

4.  Enter a *Business Name* for the hierarchy.

5.  Choose *Verify* to check the key definition. If the hierarchy contains more values than the object in the Business Builder, you can still save it, and the entries which do not fit are ignored.

6.  Save the hierarchy.
