# Creating a Fact Model

Fact models are reusable models you can use to streamline the creation of other models within the same business context.



## Prerequisites

You already have analytical datasets, dimensions, or fact models defined.



## Context

Fact models let you predefine an array of measures, attributes, and filters that are relevant to a specific business context. Fact models can then be reused in several use cases within that business context.

As an example, you have five consumption models that require the same ten calculated attributes. Instead of defining each of the ten calculated attributes five times, you can create a single fact model that includes those calculated attributes you need and reuse it in each consumption model where it's relevant.



## Procedure

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3">îš›</span> \(*Business Builder*\), select a space if necessary, and click *New Fact Model* to open the editor.

2.  Enter a title for your fact model.

3.  Choose the initial fact source you want to use in your fact model: you can choose analytical datasets, dimensions or fact models.

4.  Enter an alias for your initial fact source and click *Create*.

    At this point, your fact model is ready to use. You can also choose to include or remove measures and attributes relevant to several use cases within a same business context.

5.  Define the *Measures* of your fact model. For more information, see [Define Measures](define-measures-d430469.md).

6.  Define the *Attributes* of your fact model. For more information see [Define Attributes](define-attributes-1ac4502.md).

7.  Define the *Dimension Sources* which should be exposed for consumption. For more information see [Expose Dimension Sources](expose-dimension-sources-1326689.md).

8.  Define the *Filters* of your fact model. For more information see [Define Filters](define-filters-e8df759.md).
