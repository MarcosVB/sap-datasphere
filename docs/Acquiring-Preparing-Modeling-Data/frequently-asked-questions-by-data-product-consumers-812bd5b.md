## Frequently Asked Questions and Answers



### What is an activation key and how can I get it?

An activation key provides authorization to access one or multiple data products. The data provider sends the key via an email after a price has been determined between the consumer and provider. The price is negotiated outside of data marketplace.



### How can I contact a data provider?

### What different data products are there?

To find out which specific data products are available in your own Data Marketplace, you go to the landing page and start a search or browse through the displayed categories.



### Where do I find the data that I've downloaded?

Once the data product with direct download delivery mode is available to your space, the status of the delivery becomes available on the *Delivery Tracking* tab in the app *My Data Products*. You can select the data product as a source. For example, when in the *Data Builder*, you can create a new graphical view.

### How can I pay for data products?

Data marketplace provides a platform for data providers and consumers to easily transfer data products, but the price for one or multiple data products is negotiated between the provider and consumer outside of data marketplace. Once a price has been negotiated, the data provider sends an activation key to the consumer. With this key the buyer is authorized to activate the data product.
