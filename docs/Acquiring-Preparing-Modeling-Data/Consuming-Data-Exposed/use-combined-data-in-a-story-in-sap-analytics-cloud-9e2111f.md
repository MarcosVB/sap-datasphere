# Use Combined Data in a Story in SAP Analytics Cloud 

You can make a plan/actuals comparison in SAP Analytics Cloud.



## Context

You can combine the plan data with the actual data in a view in SAP Datasphere. Then you can use this combined data in a story in SAC to make a plan/actuals comparison.



## Procedure

1.  In SAP Datasphere, create a view in the Data Builder and combine the plan data with the actual data. For more information, see [Creating a Graphical View](../Acquiring-and-Preparing-Data-in-the-Data-Builder/creating-a-graphical-view-27efb47.md).

2.  Load the combined data from SAP Datasphere via a live data connection into SAP Analytics Cloud. For more information, see [Live Data Connections to SAP Data Warehouse Cloud](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/ad4281e2875949f0b4d45d1072ff4c38.html).
