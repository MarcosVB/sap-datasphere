## Context

![](images/Consumption_-_Excel_-_Live_Connection_fb0d22e.png)

You must:

-   Install the add-in \(see [Deploying the Add-In](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD_OFFICE/2b73edbc8f8f4189a36bc7a2e038185c/6a191aeefd5c464aa2adc4e1a69d4523.html) in the *SAP Analytics Cloud, Add-In for Microsoft Office* documentation.
-   Be a SAP Datasphere user with any of the standard roles. If you do not need to connect to SAP Datasphere itself, and only consume data, then an administrator can grant you the *DW Consumer* role \(see [Standard Application Roles](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f804b8efa8043539289f42f372c4862/cloud/en-US/a50a51d80d5746c9b805a2aacbb7e4ee.html "SAP Datasphere is delivered with several standard roles.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

    If data access controls have been applied, then the data you can consume will be filtered based on your user id \(see [Securing Data with Data Access Controls](https://help.sap.com/viewer/be5967d099974c69b77f4549425ca4c0/cloud/en-US/a032e51c730147c7a1fcac125b4cfe14.html "Data access controls allow you to apply row-level security to your objects. When a data access control is applied to a data layer view or a business layer object, any user viewing its data will see only the rows for which they are authorized, based on the specified criteria.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

-   Be a member of the SAP Datasphere space exposing the data \(see [Assign Members to Your Space](https://help.sap.com/viewer/be5967d099974c69b77f4549425ca4c0/cloud/en-US/9d59fe511ae644d98384897443054c16.html "As a Space Administrator, you can assign users as members of your space.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
-   Have access to an SAP Analytics Cloud tenant and have the role *BI Content Creator* or another role providing equivalent privileges.
-   Create or have access to an SAP Analytics Cloud live data connection to your SAP Datasphere tenant \(see [Live Data Connections to SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/ad4281e2875949f0b4d45d1072ff4c38.html) in the *SAP Analytics Cloud* documentation\).

> ### Note:  
> This topic focuses on the SAP Analytics Cloud add-in for Microsoft Office. You can also consume data exposed as perspectives and views in the SAP Analysis for Microsoft Office add-in \(see the [SAP Analysis for Microsoft Office](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESSOBJECTS_ANALYSIS_OFFICE) documentation\). Data exposed as analytic models cannot be consumed in the SAP Analysis for Microsoft Office add-in.
