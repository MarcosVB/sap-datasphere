# Contract Type and Pricing Model

The way the data product is delivered depends on the contract type and pricing model applied by the data provider.

The data provider can propose different types of contract:


<table>

 **License Key** 



</td>
<td valign="top">

An activation key provides authorization to access one or multiple data products. The data provider sends the key via an email after a price has been determined between the consumer and provider. The price is negotiated outside of data marketplace.

Enter the activation key you received, accept the terms of use, and select a space where the data should be stored.

License keys can be used:

-   for commercial products and are provided by the data provider after closure of the commercial agreement,

-   for any other type of product that needs access authorization \(for example for scenarios where non-public data is exchanged without payment\).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 **Free** 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Data products that are free of charge are provided without any payment. This could be public domain data or data provided by a commercial data provider as give-away data, for example. The data can be activated after accepting the data specific terms of use.

After accepting the terms of use, and selecting your space, the data product is downloaded.

For more information, see [Acquiring a Free Data Product](acquiring-a-free-data-product-4841beb.md) and [Acquiring a Free Data Product on Request](acquiring-a-free-data-product-on-request-7119182.md).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 **On Request** 



</td>
<td valign="top">

To activate a data product, you need to send a request to the data provider. You can do this directly through the user interface where an email template is created. You can edit the predefined email and then send it to the provider who then gets in touch with you.

For more information, see [Acquiring a Data Product on Request](acquiring-a-data-product-on-request-d212107.md).
