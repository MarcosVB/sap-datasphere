# Create a Restricted Measure



## Context



## Procedure

1.  You are in the editor of your analytic model. You can createa new currency conversion measure by clicking the background of the canvas and choosing <span class="FPA-icons">î˜‰</span> Add Measure in the properties panel. Choose *Restricted Measure*.

2.  Select the source measure.

3.  Select the aggregation type.

4.  Enter your expression in the formula editor. An atomic expression usually has the format`<dimension> <operator> <value> (e.g. Country = 'Germany').`

5.  You can enable constant selection for the restricted measure. You can choose to set it for all dimensions or just for selected dimensions. A measure with constant selection will not be impacted by filters or drill-downs on the constant dimensions.

    Enabling constant selection is useful for comparing a single value with several different values. For example, you could create a restricted measure for sales in 2022, and then compare sales in 2022 with sales for all other years in the same table.
