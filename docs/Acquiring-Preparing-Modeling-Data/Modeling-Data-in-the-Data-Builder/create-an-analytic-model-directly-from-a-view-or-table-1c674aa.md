# Create an Analytic Model Directly From a View or Table

You can create one or more analytic models directly from views or tables with a *Semantic Usage* of *Fact* \(or *Analytical Dataset*\).



<a name="loio1c674aa858fa475fb36492972e418beb__steps_gzc_r1w_3xb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Open the appropriate editor and ensure that your table or view has a *Semantic Usage* of *Fact* \(or *Analytical Dataset*\).

    Analytic models cannot be created from entities with other semantic usage.

2.  Click *Create Analytic Model* under the *Semantic Usage* property.

    The analytic model editor opens directly with the view or table added as a source, with all its properties included.

3.  \[optional\] Remove any unwanted measures or dimensions and edit the analytic model in any appropriate manner \(see [Creating an Analytic Model](creating-an-analytic-model-e5fbe9e.md)\).

4.  Save and deploy your analytic model to expose it for consumption.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can create as many analytic models as necessary from each view or table.
