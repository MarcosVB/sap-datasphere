# Convert Analytical Datasets into Analytic Models

You can convert tables and views with the *Semantic Usage* of *Analytical Dataset* easily into an analytic model.



## Procedure

1.  For tables: In the table editor, under the *Semantic Usage* droptown menu, click on *Create Analytic Model*.

2.  For views: In the view editor output node side panel, under the *Semantic Usage* droptown menu, click on *Create Analytic Model*.

3.  A new analytic model is created with the view/table as a source. All the properties are taken over into the new analytic model. Enter a descriptive name for your analytic model.

4.  You can now save this analytic model as it is, or edit it.
