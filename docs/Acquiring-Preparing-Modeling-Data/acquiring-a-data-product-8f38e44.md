# Acquiring a Data Product

Acquire a data product and make it available to your space for further use.

The way you receive data products, depends on the contract type and pricing model that the data provider has defined for the data product. For more information see [Data Shipment](data-shipment-837e749.md) and [Contract Type and Pricing Model](contract-type-and-pricing-model-4dd32d5.md).

You can acquire a product using different ways. For more information, refer to following chapters:

-   [Acquiring a Free Data Product](acquiring-a-free-data-product-4841beb.md)
-   [Acquiring a Free Data Product on Request](acquiring-a-free-data-product-on-request-7119182.md)
-   [Acquiring a Data Product on Request](acquiring-a-data-product-on-request-d212107.md)
-   [Acquiring a Data Product that needs a License Key](acquiring-a-data-product-that-needs-a-license-key-a4fd9d6.md)

Once the data product with direct download delivery mode is available to your space, the status of the delivery becomes available on the *Delivery Tracking* tab in the app *My Data Products*. You can select the data product as a source. For example, when in the *Data Builder*, you can create a new graphical view. Under *Sources* â†’ *Connections*, you'll find the data products with their corresponding schema.
