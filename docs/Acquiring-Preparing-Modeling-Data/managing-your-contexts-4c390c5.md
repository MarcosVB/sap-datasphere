# Managing your Contexts

Manage the contexts you are member of.

The *My Contexts* app gives you an overview of all contexts you are a member of. You can join new contexts or leave the ones you don't want to be member of any longer.

Depending on the data providers' choice, they can publish their data products in the *Public Data Marketplace*, which is managed by SAP for all users of SAP Datasphere or in their own private data marketplace. Contexts help data providers to differentiate between public and private data marketplaces. In a private data marketplace only you and others who have joined the corresponding context as members have access to the data products offered by the private data provider. Private data products cannot be found in the Public Data Marketplace in SAP Datasphere.

To become a member of a context, you must activate a member activation key. You will receive this key from the data provider. When you are member of a context, you have access to all data products which are published in this context.

You find the *My Contexts* app within the Data Marketplace menu.

The app shows a table including details of the contexts you are a member of:


<table>

## Joining a Context

To join a context, become a member by clicking on the button *Join*.

Enter the context member activation key which you have received from the data provider who is also the context owner and click on the button *Activate*.

You can now find and acquire the data products which are available in this context. Remember that you still would need a licence key for some data products.

## Leaving a Context

To leave a context, choose the respective context from the table and click on the button *Leave*. Confirm your action.

If you leave a context, you will no longer be able to find or acquire the data products which are published in this context. Data products which you have purchased will still be available in your *My Data Products* app and will receive also future updates.

> ### Note:  
> It's not possible to leave the context *Public Data Marketplace* by SAP which is available by default for all users of Data Marketplace. You can set this context to hidden if you don't want to see its data products on the landing page and while searching.
