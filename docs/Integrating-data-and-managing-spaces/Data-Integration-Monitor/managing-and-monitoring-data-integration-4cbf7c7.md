# Managing and Monitoring Data Integration

From <span class="FPA-icons">Óùï</span> \(*Data Integration Monitor*\), you can run and monitor data replication for remote tables, monitor data flow and task chain runs, add and monitor persisted views, and track the queries sent to your remote connected source systems for your space.

> ### Note:  
> For optimal performance, it is recommended that you consider staggering the scheduled run time of tasks such as data flows and task chains that may contain these tasks. There is a limit on how many tasks can be started at the same time. If you come close to this limit, scheduled task runs may be delayed and, if you go beyond the limit, some scheduled task runs might even be skipped.

*Data Integration Monitor* is composed of five monitors that help you track how data are managed within your space:

-   *Remote Table Monitor*: Copy data for remote tables that have been deployed in your space and monitor the replication of the data. Copy or schedule copying the full set of data from the source, or set up replication of data changes in real-time via change data capturing \(CDC\). For more information, see [Replicating Data and Monitoring Remote Tables](replicating-data-and-monitoring-remote-tables-4dd95d7.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > Remote tables from a source that is configured as data access *Remote Only* are not displayed in this monitor. For more information, see [Managing and Monitoring Data Integration](managing-and-monitoring-data-integration-4cbf7c7.md) 

-   *View Persistency Monitor*: Add, monitor and schedule persisted views. Turn your views into persisted views to improve performance while accessing your data. For more information, see [Adding and Monitoring Persisted Views](adding-and-monitoring-persisted-views-9af04c9.md).
-   *Data Flow Monitor*: View and monitor the execution details of the executed data flows. For more information, see [Monitoring Flows](monitoring-flows-b661ea0.md).
-   *Remote Query Monitor*:
    -   *Remote Queries*: Check and analyze how the communication is running between the federation layer of SAP HANA Cloud and the connected remote source systems. For more information, see [Monitoring Remote Queries](monitoring-remote-queries-806d7f0.md).
    -   *Remote Table Statistics*: Create statistics for your remote tables to improve federated query execution. For more information, see [Creating Statistics for Your Remote Tables](creating-statistics-for-your-remote-tables-e4120bb.md).

-   *Task Chain Monitor*: Monitor the status and progress of running and past task chains. For more information, see [Monitoring Task Chains](monitoring-task-chains-4142201.md).

Depending on your role and the tasks you need to perform in the *Data Integration Monitor*, you may need specific privileges. See [Managing Roles and Privileges](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/3740dacbc2794f33bb5d8d42216cc3bc.html "Assigning roles to your users maintains access rights and secures your information in SAP Datasphere.") :arrow_upper_right:.

Here are some examples of privileges and permissions you would need to perform some tasks:

-   To create or update connections, you need the *Data Warehouse Remote Connection* privilege.
-   To perform one-time actions in one of the monitors, such as replicating full set of data, redeploying persisted views, loading new snapshot, or removing persisted data, you need the *Data Warehouse Data Integration* privilege and the **Update** permission.
-   To schedule tasks in one of the monitors and perform task execution and log retrieval in general, you need the *Data Warehouse Data Integration* privilege and the **Execute** permission.
-   To add a new view in the *View Persistency Monitor*, or to set up or change partitioned data loading in the *Remote Table Monitor*, you need the *Data Warehouse Data Builder* privilege with **Read** permission.
