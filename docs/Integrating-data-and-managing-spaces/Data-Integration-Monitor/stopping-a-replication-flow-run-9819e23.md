# Stopping a Replication Flow Run

You can stop a replication flow run if you do not need it any more.

If you do so, the flow run is stopped permanently in SAP Datasphere as well as in the source. You can still run it again, but it will then start from scratch \(rather then from where it left off when you stopped it\). If you stop a replication flow run because you don't need it anymore, you should also delete it so that it does not clutter your system. For more information, see [Deleting a Replication Flow](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c8a54ee704e94e15926551293243fd1d/cloud/en-US/bdd81ec3fb144bdab7d3a7dc25947efe.html "You can delete a replication flow if you do not need it anymore and thus free up capacity.") :arrow_upper_right:.
