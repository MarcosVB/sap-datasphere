# Add an Additional Feature to an Existing Connection

Use your connection for a feature that wasn’t supported for the connection type before.

With earlier versions of SAP Datasphere some connection types supported either remote tables or data flows, and only with a later version started to support the other feature. For these connection types, you need to explicitly enable existing connections for the other feature. A warning icon at the connection indicates that there is a feature that has not been enabled yet.

To enable your connection for an additional feature the connection needs to be re-generated. Therefore re-entering your credentials is required:

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons"></span> \(*Connections*\), select a space if necessary, and then click the *Local Connections* tab.

2.  Select the connection and click *Edit*.

3.  Re-enter your credentials.

4.  Click *Save*.
