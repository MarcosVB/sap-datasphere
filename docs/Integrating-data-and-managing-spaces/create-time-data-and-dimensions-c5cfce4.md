# Create Time Data and Dimensions

As a Space Administrator, you can enrich your models and stories even further by creating a time-related table for your space.



Information such as years, quarters, months and days enrich your models even further by providing additional time-related information. By creating hierarchies based on a specific granularity, time dimensions also allow you to drill down on stories. You can create a time dimension table within a space, which then allows you to add the time dimensions to your objects in the modeling tools. A time table is created only once per space.



1.  Go to *Space Management* â†’ select the space where you want to add a time data table.

2.  Go to *Time Data* and click *Create Time Tables and Dimensions*.

3.  Use the default name or give your time data table an individual name. A technical name is automatically assigned.

4.  Select a time range \(years\) for your time table. The default value is 1900 - 2050.

5.  Four time dimensions are created with default names; Year, Quarter, Month, and Day. You can change the business name if necessary, but the technical names are predefined and cannot be edited.

6.  Translation tables are created for the different languages that are needed for the dimension names \(for example, "Day" or "Year"\). You can also change the business names, but not the technical names.

7.  Select *Save* and if necessary refresh to see a new or an updated time dimension table.


Your newly created models are now available and you can create views on top of your time data table and dimensions.
